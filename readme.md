# Image Encryption and Decryption

This project implements a simple encryption and decryption algorithm for images using the Python Imaging Library (PIL). The algorithm modifies the RGB values of each pixel based on a user-defined shift value, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt images easily.

## Features

- Supports both RGB and RGBA image formats.
- User-friendly interface for encryption and decryption.
- Simple shift-based algorithm for modifying pixel values.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the Pillow library installed. You can install Pillow using pip:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nitinbeniwal/PRODIGY_CS_02.git
   cd image-encryption
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python encrypt_decrypt.py
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to enter the image path, shift value, and choose whether to encrypt or decrypt the image.

## Example

- Encrypting an image:
  ```
  Enter the path to the image file: example.png
  Enter the shift value for encryption/decryption: 5
  Do you want to (e)ncrypt or (d)ecrypt the image? e
  Encrypted image saved as encrypted_image.png
  ```

- Decrypting an image:
  ```
  Enter the path to the image file: encrypted_image.png
  Enter the shift value for encryption/decryption: 5
  Do you want to (e)ncrypt or (d)ecrypt the image? d
  Decrypted image saved as decrypted_image.png
  ```
